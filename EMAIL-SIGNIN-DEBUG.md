# Email Sign-In Debug - Enhanced Logging

**File:** `/Users/exe/Downloads/Cursor/shuield2/EMAIL-SIGNIN-DEBUG.md`

## 🔍 Problem

After signing in with email, the dashboard is not populating with wallet data. Console logs show:
```
✅ [Dashboard] User signed in, loading account data...
```

But nothing after that - no wallet data, no errors, just silence.

## 🛠️ What I Added

### 1. **Dashboard Page** (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`)

Added comprehensive logging to track the auth flow:

```typescript
if (event === 'SIGNED_IN' || event === 'TOKEN_REFRESHED') {
  console.log("✅ [Dashboard] User signed in, loading account data...");
  
  // Migrate any anonymous wallets into the account once upon sign-in
  console.log("🔄 [Dashboard] Starting wallet migration...");
  try {
    const result = await migrateWalletsToAccount();
    console.log("✅ [Dashboard] Migration complete:", result);
    if (result.migratedCount > 0) {
      console.log(`✅ Migrated ${result.migratedCount} anonymous wallet(s) to account`);
    }
  } catch (e) {
    console.error('❌ [Dashboard] Wallet migration failed:', e);
  }

  // Force reload dashboard data
  console.log("🔄 [Dashboard] Reloading dashboard with authenticated session...");
  try {
    await loadDashboardData();
    console.log("✅ [Dashboard] Data loaded successfully!");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("❌ [Dashboard] Error loading data:", error);
  }
  checkForSavePrompt();
}
```

### 2. **Wallet Migration** (`utils/wallet/simplified-operations.ts`)

Added detailed logging to `migrateWalletsToAccount()`:

```typescript
export async function migrateWalletsToAccount() {
  console.log("🔄 [Migrate] Starting migration...");
  
  const supabase = createSupabaseClient();
  console.log("🔄 [Migrate] Getting session...");
  const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
  const user = session?.user || null;
  console.log("🔄 [Migrate] User:", user ? user.email : "none");
  
  if (!user) {
    console.log("❌ [Migrate] No user authenticated");
    return { success: false, migratedCount: 0, errors: ['User not authenticated'] };
  }

  console.log("🔄 [Migrate] Getting anonymous wallets from storage...");
  const anonymousWallets = getAnonymousWalletsFromStorage();
  console.log("🔄 [Migrate] Found anonymous wallets:", anonymousWallets.length);
  
  if (anonymousWallets.length === 0) {
    console.log("✅ [Migrate] No wallets to migrate");
    return { success: true, migratedCount: 0, errors: [] };
  }

  console.log("🔄 [Migrate] Getting existing user wallets...");
  const existingWallets = await getUserWallets(supabase);
  console.log("🔄 [Migrate] Found existing wallets:", existingWallets.length);
  
  // ... rest of migration logic
}
```

## 🧪 What You Should See Now

When you sign in with email, you should see a **complete log trail**:

### **Expected Console Output:**

```
✅ [Dashboard] User signed in, loading account data...
🔄 [Dashboard] Starting wallet migration...
🔄 [Migrate] Starting migration...
🔄 [Migrate] Getting session...
🔄 [Migrate] User: vicnshane@icloud.com
🔄 [Migrate] Getting anonymous wallets from storage...
🔄 [Migrate] Found anonymous wallets: 0
✅ [Migrate] No wallets to migrate
✅ [Dashboard] Migration complete: {success: true, migratedCount: 0, errors: []}
🔄 [Dashboard] Reloading dashboard with authenticated session...
🔄 [Dashboard] Fetching wallets...
🔍 getAllWallets: User authenticated: eec03d28-3787-49e0-8009-84ddb7c18858
🔍 getAllWallets: Fetching from database...
🔍 getAllWallets: Found authenticated wallets: 1
✅ [Dashboard] Data loaded successfully!
```

### **If It Hangs:**

If the logs **stop** at a specific point, that tells us **exactly** where the problem is:

- **Stops after "Starting wallet migration"** → `migrateWalletsToAccount()` is hanging
- **Stops after "Getting session"** → `supabase.auth.getSession()` is hanging
- **Stops after "Getting existing user wallets"** → `getUserWallets()` is hanging
- **Stops after "Reloading dashboard"** → `loadDashboardData()` is hanging

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Sign out** from the dashboard
2. **Sign in** with email (`vicnshane@icloud.com`)
3. **Copy ALL console output** (from the moment you click "Sign In" until it stops logging)
4. **Send it to me** so I can see exactly where it's hanging

This will pinpoint the exact function that's causing the issue! 🔍
