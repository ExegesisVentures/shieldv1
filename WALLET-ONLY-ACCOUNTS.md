# Wallet-Only Accounts Implementation

## Overview
ShieldNest fully supports **wallet-only accounts** where users can create an account and sign in using ONLY their wallet signature - no email or password required.

## Account Types

### 1. **Wallet-Only Account** (Anonymous Auth)
- **Sign in**: Wallet signature only
- **Identity**: Wallet address
- **Database**: Full profile in database (not localStorage)
- **Features**: Complete access to all features
- **Sync**: Works across devices (via wallet signature)
- **Email**: None (optional to add later)

### 2. **Email Account**
- **Sign in**: Email/password OR wallet signature
- **Identity**: Email address
- **Database**: Full profile in database
- **Features**: Complete access + email notifications
- **Sync**: Works across devices
- **Email**: Required

### 3. **Hybrid Account** (Wallet + Email)
- **Sign in**: Email/password OR wallet signature
- **Identity**: Both email and wallet
- **Database**: Full profile in database
- **Features**: Complete access + email notifications
- **Sync**: Works across devices
- **Email**: Added to wallet-only account

## Implementation Details

### **No Restrictions for Anonymous Users**

✅ **Confirmed**: The system does NOT restrict anonymous (wallet-only) users from any features.

**API Check** (`/api/coreum/user-rewards/route.ts`):
```typescript
// Line 256-258
const user = await getAuthenticatedUser(request);
const isAuthenticated = !!user;
// Authentication is "optional for basic functionality"
// No is_anonymous checks anywhere in the API
```

**Result**: Wallet-only users have full access to:
- ✅ Historical rewards
- ✅ Portfolio tracking
- ✅ Multiple wallets
- ✅ All dashboard features
- ✅ Cross-device sync (via wallet signature)

---

## Enhanced Features

### **1. Auto-Connect Wallet** (`AutoConnectWallet.tsx`)

**Enhanced to handle:**

#### **A. Wallet Upgrade**
If user manually added a wallet, then connects with Keplr:
```typescript
// Before: read_only: true, ownership_verified: false
// After:  read_only: false, ownership_verified: true
```

#### **B. Anonymous Account Merging**
If wallet exists in an anonymous account, then user creates email account:
```typescript
// 1. Transfer wallet to new account
// 2. Delete empty anonymous account
// 3. User keeps all wallet data
```

#### **C. Smart Detection**
```typescript
// Scenario 1: Wallet in current account
→ Upgrade if needed (read_only → verified)

// Scenario 2: Wallet in anonymous account
→ Merge to current account

// Scenario 3: Wallet in another user's account
→ Skip (cannot merge non-anonymous accounts)

// Scenario 4: Wallet doesn't exist
→ Add as new wallet
```

**File**: `/components/auth/AutoConnectWallet.tsx`

**Logs to watch for:**
```
🔄 [AutoConnect] Upgrading existing wallet to verified
✅ [AutoConnect] Wallet upgraded successfully!

🔀 [AutoConnect] Wallet belongs to anonymous account, merging...
✅ [AutoConnect] Wallet merged from anonymous account!
🗑️ [AutoConnect] Deleted empty anonymous account

➕ [AutoConnect] Adding new Keplr wallet to account
✅ [AutoConnect] Successfully added Keplr wallet to account!
```

---

### **2. Add Email to Wallet Account** (`AddEmailToWalletAccount.tsx`)

**New Component**: Allows wallet-only users to optionally add email.

**Benefits:**
- 📧 Email notifications
- 🔐 Backup sign-in (email + password)
- 🔄 Account recovery
- 📱 Sign in without wallet extension

**Usage:**
```tsx
import AddEmailToWalletAccount from "@/components/account/AddEmailToWalletAccount";

// In settings page or dashboard
{user?.is_anonymous && (
  <AddEmailToWalletAccount />
)}
```

**File**: `/components/account/AddEmailToWalletAccount.tsx`

**How it works:**
```typescript
// Updates anonymous user to have email
await supabase.auth.updateUser({
  email: "user@example.com",
  password: "secure_password"
});

// User keeps:
// - All wallet data
// - All portfolio history
// - All connected wallets
// - Can still sign in with wallet
```

   ➕ [AutoConnect] Adding new Keplr wallet to account
   ✅ [AutoConnect] Successfully added Keplr wallet to account!
   ```
4. **Verify in database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM auth.users WHERE is_anonymous = true;
   SELECT * FROM wallets WHERE address = 'core1...';
   ```
5. **Sign out and sign in again** (with wallet only)
6. **Check all features work** (portfolio, rewards, etc.)

### **Test Anonymous Account Merging:**

1. **Browser 1**: Connect Wallet A → Creates Anonymous Account 1
