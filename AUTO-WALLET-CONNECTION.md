# Auto-Connect Wallet Feature

## Overview
Automatically adds a user's connected Keplr wallet to their account after sign-up or sign-in, providing a seamless onboarding experience.

## Problem Solved
Previously, when a user:
1. Connected their Keplr wallet (as a visitor)
2. Created an account
3. Signed in

Their connected wallet was NOT automatically added to their account, requiring manual re-connection.

## Solution
Created `AutoConnectWallet` component that:
1. Runs automatically when the dashboard loads
2. Checks if the user is authenticated
3. Detects if Keplr is connected
4. Verifies the wallet isn't already in the account
5. Automatically adds it with proper settings

## Files Created/Modified

### **NEW: `/shuieldnestorg/components/auth/AutoConnectWallet.tsx`**
- Client-side component that handles automatic wallet detection and addition
- Runs once per session with a 1-second delay to ensure auth state is settled
- Adds wallet with:
  - `label`: "Keplr Wallet"
  - `read_only`: false (Keplr wallets can sign transactions)
  - `is_primary`: true (if it's the user's first wallet)
  - `ownership_verified`: true (Keplr wallets are verified by default)

### **MODIFIED: `/shuieldnestorg/app/dashboard/page.tsx`**
- Added `AutoConnectWallet` component to the dashboard
- Renders as a hidden component (returns null)
- Triggers on every dashboard visit

## User Flow

### Before (‚ùå Poor UX):
```
1. User visits site ‚Üí Connects Keplr wallet
2. User creates account ‚Üí Signs in
3. Dashboard shows 0 wallets ‚ùå
4. User has to manually click "Add Wallet" and reconnect
```

### After (‚úÖ Great UX):
```
1. User visits site ‚Üí Connects Keplr wallet
2. User creates account ‚Üí Signs in
3. Dashboard automatically detects Keplr wallet ‚úÖ
4. Wallet is added to account automatically ‚úÖ
5. Page refreshes to show wallet balance ‚úÖ
```

## Technical Details

### Detection Logic:
```typescript
1. Check if user is authenticated
2. Check if window.keplr exists
3. Get connected address via keplrGetAddress()
4. Check if wallet already exists in account
5. If not, add it to the database
6. Trigger wallet refresh event
7. Reload page to update UI
```

### Safety Features:
- ‚úÖ Only runs once per session (prevents duplicate additions)
- ‚úÖ Checks if wallet already exists (idempotent)
- ‚úÖ Handles errors gracefully (logs but doesn't crash)
- ‚úÖ Only runs for authenticated users
- ‚úÖ Only runs if Keplr is actually connected

### Database Integration:
- Uses `getAllWallets()` to check existing wallets
- Inserts into `wallets` table with proper `public_user_id`
- Sets `is_primary` to true if it's the user's first wallet
- Triggers `walletDatabaseChange` event for UI updates

## Benefits

1. **Seamless Onboarding**: Users don't have to reconnect their wallet after signing up
2. **Reduced Friction**: One less step in the user journey
3. **Better UX**: Wallet appears immediately after sign-in
4. **Verified by Default**: Keplr wallets are marked as verified
5. **Primary Wallet**: Automatically set as primary if it's the first wallet

## Console Logs

When the feature runs, you'll see:
```
üîå [AutoConnect] Found connected Keplr wallet: core1...
‚úÖ [AutoConnect] Successfully added Keplr wallet to account!
```

If the wallet already exists:
```
üîå [AutoConnect] Wallet already in account, skipping
```

If Keplr is not connected:
```
üîå [AutoConnect] No Keplr wallet connected, skipping
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Support for Leap and Cosmostation wallets
2. Show a toast notification when wallet is auto-added
3. Option to disable auto-connect in user settings
4. Support for multiple connected wallets (auto-add all)

## Testing

To test this feature:
1. Clear browser data (or use incognito)
2. Connect Keplr wallet
3. Create a new account
4. Sign in
5. Check dashboard - wallet should appear automatically
6. Check console for auto-connect logs

## Notes

- The component uses a 1-second delay to ensure auth state is fully settled
- Page reloads after adding wallet to ensure all components update
- Only works with Keplr currently (can be extended to other providers)
- Does not interfere with manual wallet addition
