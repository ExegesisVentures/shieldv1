o disable verbose logging in production. whats this mean?

Disabling verbose logging in production means reducing or turning off detailed log messages (like debug or info logs) when your application is running in a live, user-facing environment (production), as opposed to during development or testing.

Why Do This?
Security: Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive information.
Performance: Reduces unnecessary processing and storage.
Clarity: Keeps logs focused on important issues (warnings, errors).
How Is This Done?
In most projects, you control the log level with an environment variable or configuration setting. For example, in the CoreDEX-API project, you can set the LOG_LEVEL environment variable:


export LOG_LEVEL=error
In development, you might use debug or info to see more details.
In production, you set it to warn, error, or fatal to only log important issues.
Reference:

To set a log level, configure LOG_LEVEL with:

debug
info
warn
error
fatal
Where the more detailed the level is set, all previous levels will be outputted to the logs.

In summary:
Disabling verbose logging in production means only logging whatâ€™s necessary (like errors), not all the detailed information you might want during development.
