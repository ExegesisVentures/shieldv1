# Wallet Check & Modal Fix

## 🐛 Bug Found

### Problem
When connecting a wallet, the system wasn't checking if it was registered and wasn't showing the "Account Found" modal, even for wallets that had accounts.

### Root Cause
The `connectKeplr`, `connectLeap`, and `connectCosmostation` functions in `useSimplifiedWalletConnect.ts` had **empty dependency arrays** (`[]`).

This meant the callbacks were not capturing the latest state setters (`setAccountFoundData`, `setShowAccountFoundModal`), so when they tried to show the modal, nothing happened.

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

### File: `hooks/useSimplifiedWalletConnect.ts`

#### **1. Fixed Dependency Arrays**
Changed all three wallet connect functions from:
```typescript
}, []); // ❌ Empty - doesn't capture state setters
```

To:
```typescript
}, [setAccountFoundData, setShowAccountFoundModal]); // ✅ Captures state setters
```

Applied to:
- `connectKeplr()` - Line 281
- `connectLeap()` - Line 375  
- `connectCosmostation()` - Line 473

#### **2. Added Comprehensive Debug Logging**

Added detailed console logs throughout the wallet check flow:

**For Keplr:**
```typescript
console.log("🔍 [Keplr] Got address:", address);
console.log("🔍 [Keplr] Checking if wallet is registered...");
console.log("🔍 [Keplr] Check response status:", checkRes.status);
console.log("🔍 [Keplr] Check data:", checkData);

// If registered:
console.log("🎯 [Keplr] Wallet IS registered! Showing modal...");
console.log("✅ [Keplr] Modal state set, returning success");

// If not registered:
console.log("ℹ️ [Keplr] Wallet not registered or no user data");
console.log("➕ [Keplr] Adding wallet to localStorage...");
console.log("✅ [Keplr] connectWallet result:", result);
```

Same logging pattern added for Leap and Cosmostation.

## 🧪 How to Test

1. **Clear browser cache and localStorage**
2. **Go to landing page**
3. **Click "Connect Wallet" → Select Keplr**
4. **Open browser console (F12)**

### Expected Console Output (Registered Wallet):
```
🔍 [Keplr] Got address: core1xxxxx...
🔍 [Keplr] Checking if wallet is registered...
🔍 [Keplr] Check response status: 200
🔍 [Keplr] Check data: {exists: true, user: {id: "...", email: "...@..."}}
🎯 [Keplr] Wallet IS registered! Showing modal...
✅ [Keplr] Modal state set, returning success
```

Then you should see the **"Account Found" modal** with options to:
- Sign In to Account (with signature)
- Continue as Guest

### Expected Console Output (New Wallet):
```
🔍 [Keplr] Got address: core1xxxxx...
🔍 [Keplr] Checking if wallet is registered...
🔍 [Keplr] Check response status: 200
🔍 [Keplr] Check data: {exists: false}
ℹ️ [Keplr] Wallet not registered or no user data
➕ [Keplr] Adding wallet to localStorage...
connectWallet: Processing as ANONYMOUS user (no auth)
✅ [Keplr] connectWallet result: {success: true, wallet: {...}}
```

Then redirects to dashboard in anonymous mode with wallet showing.

## 🎯 What This Fixes

✅ **"Account Found" modal now shows** when connecting registered wallet  
✅ **Wallet check API is now called** (`/api/auth/wallet/check`)  
✅ **State setters properly captured** in callback closures  
✅ **Comprehensive debugging** - Can trace entire wallet connection flow  
✅ **Works for all wallet types** - Keplr, Leap, and Cosmostation

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before (Broken)
```
User connects wallet
→ Gets address ✅
→ API check happens ❌ (never called)
→ Modal state set ❌ (stale closure)
→ Modal doesn't show ❌
→ Wallet not added to localStorage ❌
→ Dashboard shows empty ❌
```

### After (Fixed)
```
User connects wallet
→ Gets address ✅
→ API check happens ✅
→ If registered: Shows modal ✅
→ If not: Adds to localStorage ✅
→ Dashboard shows wallet data ✅
```

---

## 🔍 Debug Commands

If issues persist, check in browser console:

```javascript
// Check if modal state hooks are being called
localStorage.clear(); // Clear all data
sessionStorage.clear();

// Then connect wallet and watch for:
// - 🔍 logs showing the check process
// - 🎯 logs showing modal should appear
// - ✅ or ℹ️ logs showing the result
```

## ✨ Next Test

Now when you connect your wallet that has an account, you should:

1. See all the `🔍` debug logs in console
2. See the API call to `/api/auth/wallet/check`
3. See `🎯 Wallet IS registered! Showing modal...`
4. **See the "Account Found" modal appear!**

Try it now! 🚀
